                <span>The Meditation Tracker is quite self explanatory in the sense that it keeps track of your Meditation stacks in a better way than showing them in the buff bar.
                    <br>Currently the features implemented are
                    <br>- A visual gauge, either in the style of Aetherflow or in the style of a "simplified" gauge (see above).
                    <br>- An Audio que for reaching 3 stacks, the same audio que as is used once any job gauge is maxed out (such as kenki).
                    <br>- A Text-to-Speech callout when you gain stacks.
                    <br>- A Combo ring meant to be placed on the Shoha button on your hotbar that will display once you've reached 3 stacks. 
                    <br><img src="../screens/shoharing.png">
                    <br>These features can be disabled/modified individually so you can more or less get the setup you'd like.

                    Installing triggers in Triggernometry is pretty straightforward. I am at this point assuming you have <a href="https://github.com/paissaheavyindustries/Triggernometry" title="Triggernometry">Triggernometry</a> installed.
                    <h4>Method 1 - Repo Installation</h4>
                    The easiest way, that also makes sure you get any potential updates automatically, is to just add the whole repository as a remote trigger.
                    Left click Remote Repositories in Triggernometry and add repository.
                    <br><img src="../screens/add-repo-1.png">
                    <br>Write whatever you want in the name field and plug this url into the Address
                    <br><a>https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dansa/FFXIV-Trigg/master/Triggers/TriggernometryExport.xml</a>
                    <br><img src="../screens/add-repo-2.png">
                    <br>The rest of the settings should be left as is, then you just press add and you should be good to go, barring any optional setup.
                    <br>This will install all the other triggers I have made, so make sure you disable them if you don't want to use them.
                    <br>
                    
                    <h4>Method 2 - Local Installation</h4>
                    Grab the XML file of the trigger you want, for the Meditation Tracker the URL would be
                    <br><a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dansa/FFXIV-Trigg/master/Triggers/Meditation%20Tracker/Meditate.xml">https://raw.githubusercontent.com/dansa/FFXIV-Trigg/master/Triggers/Meditation%20Tracker/Meditate.xml</a>
                    <br>Then import the XML into Triggernometry by pressing, yes, the Import button.
                    <br><img src="../screens/add-trigger-1.png">
                    <br>This will bring up a window where you can either paste the ENTIRE content of the XML file in the text field, or simply slap in the URL linked above.
                    <br><img src="../screens/add-trigger-2.png">
                    <br>Then you just press Next, and Import on the following screen and the Trigger should be imported into your Local Triggers.
