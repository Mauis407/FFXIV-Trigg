        <h3>What it do?</h3>
		<p class="ss">
			<span>The Meditation Tracker is quite self explanatory in the sense that it keeps track of your Meditation stacks in a better way than showing them in the buff bar.
                <br>Currently the features implemented are
                <br>- A visual gauge, either in the style of Aetherflow or in the style of a "simplified" gauge (see above).
                <br>- An Audio que for reaching 3 stacks, the same audio que as is used once any job gauge is maxed out (such as kenki).
                <br>- A Text-to-Speech callout when you gain stacks.
                <br>- A Combo ring meant to be placed on the Shoha button on your hotbar that will display once you've reached 3 stacks. 
                <br><img src="../screens/shoharing.png">
                <br>These features can be disabled/modified individually so you can more or less get the setup you'd like.

                Installing triggers in Triggernometry is pretty straightforward. I am at this point assuming you have <a href="https://github.com/paissaheavyindustries/Triggernometry" title="Triggernometry">Triggernometry</a> installed.
